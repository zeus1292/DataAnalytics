# DataAnalytics
A collection of codes that I'm currently using to build up my Data Science/Analytics Portfolio. I'll be adding Project Details/Code Files on a running basis.

At the moment, I've included the following - 

1) Finding a list of Restaurants using the Google Maps API.

2) Finding the market cap, % change and market weight for a given sector by scraping Fidelity.com.
